Applets
=======

Applet classes do not have much functionality, but instead serve as a container for the main components of an applet:

* Top-level Operator
* GUI
* Serializer(s)

Applets must inherit from the Applet abstract base class.  Subclasses should override the appropriate properties.  
The base class provides a few signals, which applets can use to communicate with the shell. 

.. currentmodule:: ilastik.applets.base.applet
.. autoclass:: Applet
   :members:
   
   .. automethod:: __init__

.. autoclass:: ControlCommand
   :members:

.. autoclass:: ShellRequest
   :members:

Top-level Operators
===================

Everything an applet does is centered around the applet's top-level operator.  It is typically the keeper of all state associated with the applet.
It should expose its image outputs as multi-slots, which are indexed according to the index of the currently loaded image.  See :ref:`basic-workflows` for details.

The applet GUI and the applet serializers both make changes to the top-level operator and listen for changes made to the top-level operator.
Here's an example timeline, showing a typical sequence of interactions.

1) The shell is launched with a blank workflow
    * All slots are connected, but none have any data
2) The shell loads a project file
    * Calls each serializer to read settings from the project file and apply them to the appropriate slots of the top-level operator
3) The GUI responds to the changes made to the top-level operator by updating the GUI appearance.
    * Widgets in the applet drawer(s) for the applet are updated with the current operator slot values.
4) The user changes a setting in the GUI, which in turn changes a slot value on the applet's top-level operator.
    * The changes are propagated downstream from the top-level operator, possibly resulting in an update in the central widget.
    * The applet serializer also notices the change, and makes a note that the serializer is "dirty".
5) Step 4 is repeated as the user experiments with the workflow options.
6) The user selects "Save Project"
    * The shell determines which serializers have work to do by calling isDirty()
    * The shell calls serializeToHdf5 on the dirty serializers, causing them to save the current state of the corresponding top-level operators to the project file.
7) Repeat step 4 as the user experiments with more workflow options.
8) The user attempts to close the project.
    * The shell determines if any serializers have work to do by calling isDirty().  If any declare themselves dirty, the user is asked to confirm his decision to close the project.

Applet GUIs
===========

An applet's GUI object is responsible for providing the widgets that the shell displays when this applet is selected by the user.

Here's a screenshot of the ilastik-shell gui:

.. figure:: images/ilastik-shell.png
   :scale: 100  %
   :alt: ilastik-shell screenshot

In the following figure, the areas of the GUI are labeled according to the terminology used in the ilastik code base:

.. figure:: images/ilastik-shell-gui-areas.png
   :scale: 100  %
   :alt: ilastik-shell screenshot

An applet GUI is responsible for providing the widgets for each of the areas labeled above except for the "Current Image Menu", which is 
created by the shell.  Additionally, Applet GUIs provide any menu items that should be shown when an applet is being viewed by the user.

.. currentmodule:: ilastik.applets.base.appletGuiInterface
.. autoclass:: AppletGuiInterface

Applet Serializers
==================

.. currentmodule:: ilastik.applets.base.appletSerializer
.. autoclass:: AppletSerializer
   :members:
   
   .. automethod:: _serializeToHdf5
   .. automethod:: _deserializeFromHdf5

Serializable Slots
==================

.. currentmodule:: ilastik.applets.base.appletSerializer
.. autoclass:: SerialSlot
   :members:

   .. automethod:: __init__
   .. automethod:: _serializeToHdf5
   .. automethod:: _deserializeFromHdf5

Applet Library
==============

Finally, the ilastik project serves as a library of applets that are useful for many workflows.
In particular, the :ref:`layer-viewer` applet is a base class that implements simple display of arbitrary slots from your top-level operator.  
It is intended to be used as a base class for almost all user-defined applets.
